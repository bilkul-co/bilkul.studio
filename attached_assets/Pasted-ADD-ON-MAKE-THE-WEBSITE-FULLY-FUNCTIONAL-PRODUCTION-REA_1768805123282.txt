ADD-ON: MAKE THE WEBSITE FULLY FUNCTIONAL (PRODUCTION-READY)

You will extend the existing Bilkul Digital Studio site so it is not just a pretty UI, but a complete working system for lead generation + operations.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST IMPLEMENT)

1) CONTACT / LEAD SYSTEM (END-TO-END)
- The multi-step inquiry wizard must:
  - Validate on both client + server (Zod shared schema)
  - Create a Lead record in the database
  - Send an email notification to OWNER_EMAIL with a clean formatted summary
  - Show a premium success state + next steps
- Add basic spam prevention:
  - Honeypot hidden field
  - Rate limit by IP (Upstash Redis if available; otherwise in-memory fallback)
  - Block repeated submissions within a short window

2) CRM-LITE ADMIN PANEL (REAL OPERATIONS)
Create a usable admin panel (no placeholders):
Route: /admin
Auth: simple password gate using ADMIN_PASSWORD env var (session cookie)
Admin features:
- Leads table: search, filter by status, sort by newest
- Lead detail drawer/page
- Status update: NEW → CONTACTED → QUALIFIED → CLOSED
- Add notes field (append-only log or editable notes)
- Export CSV of filtered leads
- Add “Mark as spam” status

3) CALENDAR / SCHEDULING (HIGH CONVERSION)
Add “Book a Call” functionality:
- Option A (fast): Integrate Calendly link via env var CALENDLY_URL and a modal embed
- Option B (better): Build a mini booking request form with preferred date/time and timezone
Either way:
- After booking / request, store record in DB and email owner

4) EMAIL SYSTEM (RELIABLE)
Implement Resend (preferred) or Nodemailer (SMTP) as a service:
- /server/email.ts with a single sendEmail() function
- Professional email template (HTML) with:
  - Lead summary table
  - CTA buttons: “Open Lead in Admin”
  - Reply-to set to user’s email

ENV VARS:
- OWNER_EMAIL
- RESEND_API_KEY (or SMTP creds)
- SITE_URL

5) SEO + TRUST BASELINE (LIVE-READY)
- Proper metadata on every page (title, description, OG image)
- Generate sitemap.xml and robots.txt (dynamic is fine)
- Add structured data (JSON-LD):
  - Organization schema
  - LocalBusiness/ProfessionalService schema (generic, no fake address)
- Add a “Privacy” page (/privacy) and “Terms” page (/terms) (simple, professional)

6) ANALYTICS (BUSINESS INSIGHT)
Add analytics in a privacy-respecting way:
- Option A: Plausible (if keys exist) via env var PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN
- Option B: PostHog (if keys exist) via env var POSTHOG_KEY + HOST
Track events:
- CTA click (Book a Call)
- Lead form started
- Lead form submitted
- Service page view depth (optional)
Ensure no sensitive data is tracked.

7) CMS-LIKE CONTENT MANAGEMENT (MINIMAL BUT REAL)
So you can update content without touching code:
- Case studies: editable in DB (Prisma) + admin CRUD (create/edit/publish)
- Testimonials: stored in DB + admin CRUD
- FAQs: stored in DB + admin CRUD
Keep the UI clean. Don’t overbuild—just enough to manage core content.

8) PRODUCTION QUALITY GUARDRAILS
- Add error handling + user-friendly toast notifications
- Add loading states and optimistic UI for admin updates
- Ensure mobile works perfectly
- Add a health check route: /api/health
- Add basic logging for lead submissions (no leaking secrets)

Add/extend models:

Lead:
- id, createdAt
- serviceType, businessName, industry
- goals, timeline, budgetRange (optional field, nullable for future)

- notes (string nullable)
