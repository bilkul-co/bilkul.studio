ROLE
You are Replit Agent acting as a Senior UX Engineer + Visual Systems Designer.
You will UPDATE the existing “Bilkul Digital Studio” Next.js site you just built.

GOAL
Make the site feel LIGHTER, more premium, less “all-black and dull”.
Keep the calm-luxury vibe, but introduce tasteful “bubble-glass” hues and airy depth.

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS
1) Add the attached Bilkul logo image (blue liquid-glass “B.”) into:
   - Header (left side, brand mark)
   - Footer
   - Favicon / app icons (generate basic versions or use the image as-is)
   - Optional: subtle watermark usage in hero background (VERY low opacity, tasteful)
2) Keep performance excellent (no heavy videos; optimize images).
3) Do not turn it into neon/cyberpunk. Stay premium + restrained.
4) Increase perceived brightness: more mid-tones, soft gradients, subtle glass panels.

ASSET HANDLING (LOGO)
- The logo image is provided in the repository assets or uploaded by user.
- Create these files:
  /public/brand/logo.png (original)
  /public/brand/logo-mark.png (if you need a cropped mark)
  /public/favicon.ico (basic export)
- Use Next/Image everywhere.
- Add ALT text: “Bilkul Digital Studio logo”.

VISUAL DIRECTION — “AURORA GLASS 2026”
Current issue: too black + flat.
New direction: deep navy base + luminous glass layers + soft aurora gradients.

COLOR PALETTE (USE THESE TONES, RESTRAINED)
Base:
- Ink Navy: #060A12
- Deep Midnight: #070B16
- Soft Slate: #0E1626

Luminous Accents (use sparingly, as gradients + edge highlights):
- Rare Blue: #2D6BFF
- Aquamarine: #35F5D5
- Teal: #19C3C8
- Turquoise: #41E2FF
- Clean Cyan: #7AF0FF
Bubble Hues (micro accents only):
- Soft Pink: #FF5BD6
- Violet Mist: #B18CFF

BACKGROUND & SURFACE SYSTEM (IMPORTANT)
- Replace flat black backgrounds with:
  1) A subtle radial gradient in the hero
  2) A faint aurora band (blurred) behind key sections
  3) Glass cards with soft borders and inner glow

Define tokens in:
- /lib/theme.ts (or /lib/design-tokens.ts)
- Tailwind CSS variables in globals.css

Add CSS VARIABLES like:
--bg-0, --bg-1
--glass-bg
--glass-border
--glow-blue, --glow-aqua, --glow-pink

Example background behavior (IMPLEMENT):
- Body background:
  linear-gradient(180deg, #060A12 0%, #070B16 60%, #060A12 100%)
- Hero overlay:
  radial-gradient(circle at 20% 10%, rgba(45,107,255,0.22), transparent 45%),
  radial-gradient(circle at 80% 40%, rgba(53,245,213,0.16), transparent 50%),
  radial-gradient(circle at 60% 90%, rgba(255,91,214,0.10), transparent 55%)

CARDS / PANELS (GLASS)
Update all major containers (service cards, case studies, FAQ, testimonials):
- Background: rgba(255,255,255,0.04–0.07)
- Border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.10–0.14)
- Shadow: soft, deep, spread (no harsh outlines)
- Add subtle “edge spectrum” gradient border on hover (blue→aqua→pink) very low intensity.

BUTTONS (SQUISHY + LIGHTER)
Primary button:
- Gradient: Rare Blue → Teal
- Soft glow around (opacity 0.18 max)
- Press animation: scale 0.92–0.94, spring back
Secondary button:
- Glass button with faint border + hover shimmer

TYPOGRAPHY (AIR + TRUST)
- Increase line-height and spacing slightly.
- Headlines: confident, not overly condensed.
- Body text: slightly brighter than before (avoid pure white; use off-white).
  Example:
  --text-primary: rgba(255,255,255,0.92)
  --text-secondary: rgba(255,255,255,0.70)

HEADER UPDATE (WITH LOGO)
- Left: logo mark + “Bilkul Digital Studio”
- Make header glassy: translucent background with blur on scroll
- Add a very subtle gradient hairline under the header (blue→aqua) at 10–14% opacity
- Keep nav clean and minimal.
- Add CTA button “Book a Call” (primary gradient)

WHERE TO ADD COLOR (DO NOT OVERDO)
Add color only as:
- Section background glows (blurred)
- Card hover edge highlights
- Primary CTA gradient
- Tiny accents: icons, dividers, badges
NO large neon blocks.

SECTIONS TO IMPROVE (TARGET)
1) Hero: add aurora radial glows + optional watermark logo at 2–4% opacity.
2) Services grid: glass cards + hover lift + edge sheen.
3) “AI Integration” page: give it an extra credibility look—calm, clean, minimal accents.
4) Work cards: add a subtle gradient top border + improved spacing.
5) Contact wizard: make each step feel like a premium onboarding flow with soft gradient progress bar.

ANIMATION (REFINED)
- Add “slow reveal” section motion (stagger, low distance).
- Hover: gentle lift (2–6px) + soft glow.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS (DO THESE)
1) Add logo assets to /public/brand and wire into Header + Footer + metadata icons.
2) Introduce theme tokens (CSS vars) and refactor existing colors to use tokens.
3) Update background system + hero glows.
4) Update cards, buttons, dividers to match aurora-glass system.
5) Ensure all pages remain consistent and performance stays strong.
6) Provide a short README section: “Brand + Theme” explaining where to tweak colors.

FINAL CHECKLIST
- Site looks brighter, premium, modern (not dull black).
- Logo appears properly in header/footer and feels integrated.
- Accents are rare, tasteful: rare blue + aquamarine + teal + turquoise + subtle pink.
- Smooth motion, strong readability, high trust.
- No broken layouts; mobile polish is excellent.

Proceed to implement now, end-to-end, in the existing project.
